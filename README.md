# 🚗 Self Driving Object Detection App

This is a **Streamlit-based web app** that visualizes objects in a self-driving car dataset using bounding boxes.

The app allows you to:

- Select object types like cars, pedestrians, bikers, trucks, or traffic lights.
- Choose specific frames from the dataset.
- See the bounding boxes drawn on the selected frame.
- Interactively explore object distribution in frames.
